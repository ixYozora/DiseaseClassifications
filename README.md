# DiseaseClassifications

This repository contains untrained machine learning models developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis. These models aim to classify diseases based on various datasets, exploring the use of non-invasive features for prediction.

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific disease and contains one or two models:

- **1 Model**: For diseases where the folder contains only one model, it was trained using only **non-invasive features**.
- **2 Models**: For diseases where two models are present:
  - One model was trained on **all features** available in the dataset.
  - The other model was trained using **only non-invasive features**.

### Diseases and Models

The following diseases are included in this repository:

- Alzheimer
- Breast Cancer
- Chronic Kidney Disease
- Depression
- Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence
- Heart Disease
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Pathological Voice

## Note on Weights

The models provided in this repository are **untrained**. If you require the trained weights for these models, please contact me directly.
